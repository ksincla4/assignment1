        <h2><i>Cooking Tips</i></h2>
        <p>Loving these recipes, but feeling a little unsure about your own abilities? Here are some cooking tips that will get you on your way!</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Know how to season!</strong> With some meals, you can take it a step up from salt and pepper. For others, there's no need to use every spice in your cabinet. Try to find seasoning that compliments what you're eating. You can read all about flavor pairings <i><a href="https://delishably.com/spices-seasonings/The-Ultimate-Spice-Pairing-Guide" target="_blank">here</a></i>!</li>
            <li><strong>The Perfect Rice:</strong> Tired of white rice that's too mushy, undercooked, or burnt? Take <i style="color: green">two</i> cups of water for every <i style="color: green">one</i> cup of rice. Bring the water to a boil, add the rice, turn the stove down to its lowest possible setting, and let it simmer for 18-20 minutes <strong>without removing the top!</strong> I promise, it'll be the fluffiest rice you ever eat. </li>
            <li><strong>Don't be afraid to reinvent a recipe!</strong> Take the recipes you find with a grain of salt (and pepper)! If you don't like something, exchange it for something elese. Add things you think would compliment your meal well. Even if it ends up being a mistake, you'll learn from it! That's the fun part about cooking, after all.</li>
